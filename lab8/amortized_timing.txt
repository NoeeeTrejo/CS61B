Q: Is one GrowList implementation always better than the others?
A: No, it depends on what the input array is because that determines runtime.

Q: Why is the runtime for N insertions into a geometrically resizing list a Theta(N) operation?
A: Bc the size of the array doubles after we fill the array up.

Q: Why is the runtime for N insertions into a arithmetically resizing list a Theta(N^2) operation?
A: Bc it's an array-backed list (that re-sizes through increasing the size of the array by 1 when it's filed up)

Q: How does the runtime per operation for the ArithGrowList compare to that of GeomGrowList and JavaGrowList? Specifically look at the non-accumulated plots and desribe the trends for how long each operation takes as a function of how many elements have already been inserted in the list.
A: it is proportional to the array's length because that determines the runtime.

Q: When are there spikes in the per operation runtime graphs for each of the implementations? Do these make sense to you? Hint: some of these should and others might not. Empirical runtime can be quite messy and depends on machine specifics which will be revealed in other subsequent classes like CS61C.
A: When the array's length is small and not large.

Q: Optional: Try changing the code for GeomGrowList to resize by a different factor. How does this effect the theoretical asymptotic runtime? How does this effect the plotted runtime?
A:

Q: Optional: Try changing the code for ArithGrowList to resize by adding a different fixed number of spots in the array. How does this effect the theoretical asymptotic runtime? How does this effect the plotted runtime?
