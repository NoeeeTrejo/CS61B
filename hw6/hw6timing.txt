1c. Does your ECHashStringSet look roughly linear or roughly quadratic
in its scaling behavior for random strings?
Roughly linear, because it increases the more we give it. i.e. 0.56 ~= 2 * 1.19

2c. Does your **BST**StringSet look roughly linear or roughly
quadratic in its scaling behavior for in order strings?
After trying it with 30,000 in-order strings, it took 2.00 seconds, so
it looks like linear, so inserting in order strings is theta(n)

Before submitting, make sure that your ECHashStringSet is capable of
handling inputs of size 1000000 in a reasonable amount of time (a few
seconds).
